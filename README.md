# Connect-N Game
## I have created Connect-N Game in python using pygame.

### This game consists of following modifications in comparison with Traditional Connect-4 Game :
1. User can give input for number of rows.
2. User can give input for number of columns.
3. User can give input for number of slices.
4. If user enters any wrong value, it asks for the correct input.
5. You can continue to play the game untill the user no longer wants to play.

### Run main.py file & Enjoy your Game.
